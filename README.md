Bakery Dataset Description

The data set contains 21293 observations and the following columns

 1.  Date. Categorical variable that tells us the date of the transactions (YYYY-MM-DD format). The column includes dates from 30/10/2016 to 09/04/2017.

2. Time. Categorical variable that tells us the time of the transactions (HH:MM:SS format).

3.  Transaction. Quantitative variable that allows us to differentiate the transactions. The rows that share the same value in this field belong to the same transaction, thatâ€™s why the data set has less transaction than observations.

4.  Item. Categorical variable containing the products.

 Transaction ID ranges from 1 through 9684. However, there are some skipped numbers in Transaction IDs. Also, there are duplicated entries.

1.     Give an example where you can apply the Apriori algorithm.                                             (2)

2.     What happens when we decrease the support level? Why?                                                  (4)

3.     What happens when we increase the confidence level? Why?                                               (4)

4.     How many rules are generated with a support level of 5% and a confidence level of 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%? Also visualized the generated rules.                                                                                                                     (6)

5.     How many rules are generated with a support level of 1% and a confidence level of 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, 50%, 40%, 30%, 20%, 10%? Also visualized the generated rules.                                                                                                                    (6)
